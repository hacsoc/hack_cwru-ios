# HackCWRU-ios

Do you ever feel like a plastic bad drifting through the wind, wanting to build an app?

Welcome to CWRU's brave and bold attempt at besting every hackathon app we've tried in order to not progress society but rather stay sane next spring. Of our three part plan, this is obviously the iOS application frontend. If you're in the wrong place, I'll pause for a moment so you can awkwardly leave while everyone stares at you.

We'll primarily be using Trello to track feature assignment and progress. If you aren't in the HacSoc org or haven't been added to the board, contact adam@case.edu. Major bugs are to be reported in issues up and to the right, while free beer and food is to be sent again to adam@case.edu.

Although you're more than welcome to dive into the repo, we'd prefer if you let us know what you're doing first. Contact adam@case.edu if you want to help make iOS stuff, or reach out to mason@case.edu if you're interested assisting with our Ruby on Rails backend or our sister frontend in Android.

We're using the following protocol with forking and pushing:

*If you're an owner*

  - Work on a topic branch
  - Merge in the master branch
  - Push your topic branch
  - Make a PR on GitHub
  - Wait for a +1 from another owner (and any CI hooks) before merging

*Slightly different if youâ€™re not an owner (but we still accept contributions from anyone!)*

  - Fork the repo
  - Work on a topic branch
  - Merge in the upstream master branch
  - Push your topic branch
  - Make a PR on GitHub
  - Wait for a +1 from an owner (and any CI hooks) before merging


###What's a Swift?
*Or: how I learned to stop worrying and ditch Objective-C*

Objective-C is great. Really. A bit of a bitch, but once you know what you're doing, it's fantastically delightful in a sadistic kind of way. However, it takes fucking ages to get down pat, and we don't got that long.

So we're rolling with Swift. How do you code in Swift, you ask? No fucking clue. This is a learning experience for even our iOS guy, but it'll be fun, informative, and better than trying to teach people how to masochism while making an app.

I highly recommend getting Apple's free *The Swift Programming Language* book in iBooks. It goes over all of the syntax and conventions of Swift as decreed by our Apple overlords. For a style guide, we'll go off of Wenderlich's: https://github.com/raywenderlich/swift-style-guide

Here's an example Swift repo if you want to see some sample code: https://github.com/sachinkesiraju/SwiftExample

##And remember, have fun with it!
